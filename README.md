# Bank_LoanApproval_Predictor_MLWebapp

This is a End-To-End Data Science project using Supervised Learning Classification technique for predicting wheather loan will be approved for the Customer Account holder of that Bank. Features included both Continuous and Categorical columns. Required to handle the Missing values and Categorical columns to numerical for training,testing,Predicting and evaluating  using confusion matrix followed by checking the accuracy of the model using different Classification models for finding the best model for prediction.
 
# DATA SCIENCE LIFE CYCLE:
1.Performed actions like 1.Merging the dataset from different sources, 2.Data preprocessing, 3.Exploratory Data Analysis, 4.Handling Missing Values , 5.Handling with Categorical columns, 6.Splitting the dataset into Training and testing models, 7.Making prediction, 6.Evaluating the model, 7.Used pickle file to dump and load the model, 8.Made a Web Application using Streamlit. 9.Deployed the Web Application on Streamlit Cloud Platform.

# TOOLS USED:
1.IDE (Integrated Development Environment Used)-Jupyter notebook, Spyder, 2.MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM used- Scikit-Learn Classification Algorithms, 4.WEB APPLICATION TOOL Used- Streamlit, 5.Cloud Deployment- Streamlit Cloud

# CLOUD DEPLOYED:
